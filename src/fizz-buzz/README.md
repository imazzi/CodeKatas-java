Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:

  <ul>
    <li>answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.</li>
    <li>answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.</li>
    <li>answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.</li>
    <li>answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.</li>
</ul>
