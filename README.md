<h1>TestDrivenDevelopment<h1>
<p>
TestDrivenDevelopment is a way of working, or a process for writing code. You work is paced in BabySteps and your progress is assured by frequently writing and running 
automated tests. Coding proceeds in an extremely focused and productive rhythm:
</p>  
  <ol>
    <li>Write a test for a new function. The test should fail.</li>
    <li>Write code until the test passes.</li>
    <li>Refactor until the code is suitable for continued development</li>
    <li>Goto 1.</li>
  </ol>

<p>
If we use a UnitTestFramework , like JUnit, we get nice colours on the screen telling us exactly what to do next.

Red = write function code

Green = write a new test or refactor
</p>
